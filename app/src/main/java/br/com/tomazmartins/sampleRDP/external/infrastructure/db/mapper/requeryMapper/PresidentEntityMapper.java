    * BEAM MAPPING:
    *   This annotation allow us to determine the result type.

    *   We use this because there is an inheritance
    *   relation between the abstract classes and concrete classes
    *   of the Requery.
    *
    *   In this case, we have the abstract class PRESIDENT ENTITY,
    *   that generated by Requery the concrete class
    *   PRESIDENT ENTITY IMPL.
    *   So, we use annotation BEAM MAPPING and declare that the
    *   result must be PRESIDENT ENTITY.
    *   And
    *   With the ENTITY FACTORY.createPresidentEntity(), we
    *   instantiate the concrete class, not the abstract class.
    *
    * MAPPING:
    *   With this annotation we declare some attribute to the
    *   MapStruct, to instruction it with some specification.
    *
    *   I this case, we declare to the MapStruct to ignore the
    *   attribute calls 'country'.
    *
    *   This method will be implemented by MapStruct in the
    *   generated concrete class.
