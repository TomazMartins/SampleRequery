    * ABSTRACT CLASS or INTERFACE?
    *    Requery allow us to use abstract classes or
    *    interfaces to define our entities.
    *
    *    In this example, we use abstract classes.
    *    Why?
    *    Because it is the way that I found to use
    *    Requery allied with MapStruct (generator of Mappers).
    *    I use that two frameworks because I want to
    *    develop a example of Repository Design Pattern
    *    and
    *    MVP (Model-View-Presenter).
    *
    *    With abstract classes we can implement methods
    *    and allow access of the MapStruct to the entities
    *    that it will map.
